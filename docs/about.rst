About
=====

This is a catalog of some of the pianos at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign.

Descriptions, images, and recordings of pianos are provided. The condition of
the piano at the time of writing is documented. Because most pianos are in tune,
the voicing of the piano (i.e. tone) is the main factor in quality.

Much of the reviews are my opinion. This catalog may or may not be as complete,
accurate, or rigorous as expected.

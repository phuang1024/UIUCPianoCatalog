About
=====

This is a catalog of some of the pianos at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign.

Descriptions, images, and recordings of pianos are provided. The condition of
the piano at the time of writing is documented. Because most pianos are in tune,
the tone is the main factor in quality. Tone is influenced by voicing,
age/condition, and piano size.
